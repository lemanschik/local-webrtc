1. Created manifest file in a common location on the VM image:   C:\Temp\Update.xml
File Contents:

## windows
C:\Temp\${appId}.xml
<gupdate xmlns='http://www.google.com/update2/response' protocol='2.0'>
  <app appid='${appId}'>
    <updatecheck codebase='file:///C:/Temp/${appId}.crx' version='1.5.0' />
  </app>
</gupdate>

2. Placed CRX and .xml Manifest file in the location specified in the manifest XML (C:\Temp\)
3. Set the Group Policy setting to point to the Extension ID & manifest XML file:
```
Computer Configuration\Policies\Administrative Templates\Google\Chome\Extensions
     * Extension/App IDs and update URLs to be silently installed
          = ${appId};file:///C:/Temp/${appId}.xml
```
4. Update Group Policy on the virtual machine.

## edge case installed manual before
extension enabled NOT. since the extension was already installed (by 3rd party software) & 
NOT enabled for all users by default, the Group policy setting doesn't enable it, 
likely because it's already installed. It does however, prevent the uninstall of the addon.

simply needed to deactivate the group policy setting, 
uninstall the extension, then reactivate the group policy setting.  
The extension then installs on chrome launch & is enabled and can not be uninstalled or disabled.

## Linux & MacOS
edite the profiles deployment defaults.
