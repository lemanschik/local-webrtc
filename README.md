WebRTC is a Good Protocol even for local Connections as it can be used with TCP and UDP

This is mainly designed for people who attend to my workshops and courses and other Senior Engineers
Please do not bother me with questions if your not a Course or Workshop Participant. I am Platform Engineer.
I Claim to know it better then you only if your a webrtc contributor or implementer i will take your opinions
into consideration. 

## How to use it?
The Package / Module is designed to take only sessId Propertys of the offers and execute whats called 
Perfectnegotation the rest is up to you so it is compare able to the simplePeer Module from feross but.
Designed only with the local usage usecase in mind. 

## Why?

other Applications and Context Worlds. 

## The Unlicense
This is total free Really i know you do not get it but it is what it is.
